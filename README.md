# Trails Collector

This was created as a part of the Flatiron School online webdeveloper program. 
The purpose is to give users the ability to create a collection of trails they would like to save for later, 
as a journal or as a bucket list. Users have the ability to access all the trails in the database, but only 
the creator of a trail is able to edit or delete said trail. 


## Installing
